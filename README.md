# COT4500Assignment1
Assignment 1 has 6 problems (really, 3, with the first and last having multiple sub-steps)
First, is double precision of a binary number. We're to display it with 5 digits after the decimal, then with 3 (truncating), then with 3 (rounding), and finally, to find the absolute and relative error the rounded version would have
Second, we are given an infinite series, and asked how many terms it would take to have error of less than 10^-4
Finally, given a formula f, and asked to use bisection and newton Raphson method (don't know who raphson is, but the help led me to the newton method, so I just went with that)
