Instructions:
Code is written in python, and should be able to be compiled and run in any terminal window that has python installed. It imports and uses numpy, but there shouldn't really be other requirements

Assignment Description:
Assignment 1 has 6 problems (really, 3, with the first and last having multiple sub-steps), involving decimal precision with a binary number and the error that comes with rounding/truncating, and series/functions that we must find how many terms/iterations it takes to reach an error less than a given amount
